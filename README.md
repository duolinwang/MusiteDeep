# MusiteDeep: a Deep-learning Framework for General and Kinase-specific Phosphorylation Site Prediction 

MusiteDeep provides a deep-learning method for general and kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction. It is implemented by deep learning library Keras and Theano backend. At present, MusiteDeep only provides prediction of human phosphorylation sites; however, it also provides customized model training that enables users to train other PTM prediction models by using their own training data sets based on either CPU or GPU. 
# Installation

  - Download MusiteDeep by 
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/duolinwang/MusiteDeep
  ```
  - Installation has been tested in Linux and Mac OS X with Python 2.7. 
  - Since the package is written in python 2.7, [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/ ) with the pip tool must be installed first. 
MusiteDeep uses the following dependencies:
numpy,  scipy, pandas, h5py, keras version=1.1.0
You can install these packages first, by the following commands:

```sh
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install h5py
pip install -v keras==1.1.0
pip install theano
```
To install MusiteDeep, cd to the MusiteDeep folder and run the installation command:
```sh
python setup.py install 
```
 - Since MusiteDeep is developed by theano, you must change the default backend from TensorFlow to theano.
If you have run Keras at least once, you will find the Keras configuration file at:
$HOME/.keras/keras.json
If it isn’t there, you can create it. 
Change the default configuration file into:
```sh
{	
    "image_dim_ordering": "tf",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "floatx": "float32",
    "backend": "theano"
}
```
# Running on GPU or CPU

>After you install MusiteDeep, Theano will be installed along with MusiteDeep. Refer to [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-run-keras-on-gpu)  to configure theano to run on GPU/CPU. Note that, if you want to use GPU, you also need to install [CUDA]( https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn); refer to their websites for instructions. If you use "pip install theano" to install theano (the lower but official supported version), you need to install cuDNN version 5.1. If you want to install cuDNN with higher version, you need to upgrate theano. CPU is only suitable for predicting not training. 

# For general users who want to perform human phosphorylation site prediction by our provided model :
cd to the MusiteDeep/MusiteDeep folder which contains predict.py, train_general.py and train_kinase.py.  
#### For general phosphorylation site prediction using our pre-trained model, run:
```sh
python predict.py -input [custom predicting data in fasta format] -predict-type general -output [custom specified file for predicting results] 
```
##### Example:
```sh
python predict.py -input ../testdata/testing_proteins_STY.fasta -predict-type general -output result_test_general.txt -residue-types S,T,Y
```
You can change the type of sites for prediction by setting parameter ‘-residue-types’. For our general phosphorylation site prediction, only S, T and Y are acceptable. It takes about 15 minutes for running on CPU. The warnings can be ignored.
For details of other parameters, run:
```sh
python predict.py --help
```
or
```sh
python predict.py -h
```
#### For kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction using our pre-trained model, run:
```sh
python predict.py -input [custom predicting data in fasta format] -predict-type kinase -kinase [custom specified kinase to predict] -output [custom specified file for predicting results]
```
##### Example:
Prediction for PKA:
```sh
python predict.py -input ../testdata/testing_proteins_PKA.fasta -predict-type kinase -kinase PKA -output result_test_PKA.txt
```
Prediction for CDK:
```s
python predict.py -input ../testdata/testing_proteins_CDK.fasta -predict-type kinase -kinase CDK -output result_test_CDK.txt
```
…
It takes about 5 minutes for running on CPU. The warnings can be ignored.
For details of other parameters, run:
```sh
python predict.py --help
```
or
```sh
python predict.py -h
```

# For advanced users who want to perform training and predicting by using their own data:

#### For custom training:
CPU is only suitable for prediction not training. 
For custom general training using user’s training data:
```sh
python train_general.py -input [custom training data in fasta format] -output-prefix [prefix of pre-trained model] -residue-types [custom specified residue types]
```
For details of other parameters, run:
```sh
python train_general.py --help
```
or
```sh
python train_general.py -h
```
Examples will be shown together with other commands below.

For custom kinase-specific training (or performing transfer learning) from users’ training data. To solve the small-sample problem of kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction, we encourage users to train a base network on the general phosphorylation data and then transfer the whole layers except for the last output layer of the base network to kinase-specific models by fine-tuning the whole network using the kinase-specific data. In this way, the kinase-specific models learn from the general feature representations and the overfitting problem is relieved. This approach has successfully been applied to many image classification problems and shown good classification performance by using small-sample data.

To do so by MusiteDeep, the background models from one custom general data must be trained first by train_general.py, then train the kinase-specific models by using the background models to initialize the weights in the kinase-specific models. 
```sh
python train_kinase.py -input [custom training data in fasta format] -background-prefix [prefix of pre-trained model] -output-prefix [prefix of output files]
```
For details of other parameters, run:
```sh
python train_kinase.py --help
```
or 
```sh
python train_kinase.py -h
```
Users can modify the number of transfer layers from the top layers by setting '-transferlayer TRANSFERLAYER'. 
Examples will be shown together with other commands below.

#### Custom prediction from custom general models and custom kinase-specific models:
```sh
python predict.py -input [custom predicting data in fasta format] -predict-type custom -model-prefix [prefix of pre-trained model] -output [custom specified file for predicting results] 
```
##### Examples for custom training and prediction from custom models.

When you have a lot of protein sequences in fasta format and you have changed the fasta format by adding “#” to the sites which are annotated sites of a specific PTM (use # to indicate positive sites), you can do custom general training. Taking the training of a general phosphorylation model as an example ,  training_proteins_nonredundant_STY.fasta in the ‘testdata’ folder is your training data, you can train a general model with prefix ‘custom_general’ and focusing on residues S,T, you can run the following command: 
```sh
python train_general.py -input ../testdata/training_proteins_nonredundant_STY.fasta -output-prefix custom_general_ST -residue-types S,T -nclass=5
```
Since the ‘-residue-types’ is set as S,T, only fragments center on S and T will be considered and used to train the model. Note that all the residues specified by this parameter will be trained in one model. So that S/T and Y cannot be used to train one model. For the model focusing on Y, a separate model need to be trained.
When you only have a small sample of protein sequence data, it is better to train general phosphorylation models first before training a kinase-specific phosphorylation model, then use the general phosphorylation models to initialize weights for the kinase-specific model, which is the concept of transfer learning.  Taking the training of PKA-specific phosphorylation model as an example, run the following command:
```sh
python train_kinase.py -input ../testdata/training_proteins_PKA.fasta  -background-prefix custom_general_ST -output-prefix custom_PKA -nclass=5
```
Here, custom_general_ST is the prefix of the pre-trained model by using the general phosphorylation training data ‘training_proteins_nonredundant_STY.fasta’ in the former command. You can also specify the number of the last layers to be randomly initialized by setting the parameter ‘-transferlayer’. The default value of ‘transferlayer’ is 1. If you don’t specify the residue type by parameter ‘-residue-types’, the same residues will be focused as in the general model.  You can set a different ‘-redisue-types’ from the general model. This is for training the general phosphorylation model of residue Y by using the general phosphorylation model for residues S and T as the background model to initialize weights in the new model. In this way, the performance of general phosphorylation models of residue Y is improved. Here is an example of training phosphorylation model for residue Y:
```sh
python train_kinase.py -input ../testdata/training_proteins_nonredundant_STY.fasta -background-prefix custom_general_ST -output-prefix custom_general_Y -nclass=5 -residue-types Y -transferlayer 0
```
This time only fragment’s center on Y will be considered and used to train the model.

##### Example of prediction from a custom general PTM model for residues S/T and Y:

```sh
python predict.py -input ../testdata/testing_proteins_STY.fasta -predict-type custom -model-prefix custom_general_ST -output custom_general_results.txt -residue-types S,T
python predict.py -input ../testdata/testing_proteins_STY.fasta -predict-type custom -model-prefix custom_general_Y -output custom_general_results.txt -residue-types Y
```
##### Example of prediction from a custom kinase-specific PTM model:

```sh
python predict.py -input ../testdata/testing_proteins_PKA.fasta -predict-type custom -model-prefix custom_PKA -output custom_PKA_results.txt 
```
